USING THIS PROJECT

There are two folders - 'raster' and 'vector'. Original source materials may
be present in both folders, but in general, source materials are stored in
vector form (SVG normally) under the 'vector' folder.

Because many applications require rasterized graphics, vector source materials
should ALWAYS be rasterized and stored under the 'raster' folder, preferably
as PNGs at 90dpi with a sensible resolution for web or standard print media.
If you commit a change to a vector file, please re-rasterize it in the same 
commit or in an immediatly following commit (preferred).

Additionally, some source materials are stored only in rasterized form, due to
their simple nature (such as the banner logo for the /r/SJSU subreddit). These
files are stored in the 'raster' folder and need no additional management.

Finally, some source materials are not rasterized but aren't technically
'vector' graphics either. An example would be Adobe Photoshop project files or
GIMP project files. Because the workflow is identical for these files as for
vector graphics (ie, they need to be rasterized to be viewed), treat them
identically to vector graphics, including re-rasterizing for each effecting
commit.
